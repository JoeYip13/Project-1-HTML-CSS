## Visual Design
### Figma
Figma was used in this process to help layout the structure and design of the website. 

For desktop:
<div><img src="assets/images/Feel-Good-Gym-Design3.jpg" alt="Feel Good Gym Design on Figma"></div>
For Mobile:
<div><img src="assets/images/Feel-Good-Gym-Design4.jpg" alt="Feel Good Gym Design on Figma"></div>

### Logo
Adobe Express was used to create the logo. From my prespective, I like the way visual images can instantly convey what a website is about. This is why I decided to create a logo of representation of Feel Good Gym and Training.   
<div><img src="assets/images/Feel-Good-Logo-Design2.jpg" alt="Feel Good Gym Logo Design on Adobe Express"></div>

### Fonts 
- Primary font was Inter 400. I chose this font because it showed a neutral, plain but informative feel. This font also worked well against the colour scheme. 
<div><img src="assets/images/Google-Fonts-Inter-400.jpg" alt="Google Fonts Inter 400"></div>

### Icons

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/Font-Awesome-Icons.jpg" alt="Font Awesome Icons"></div>

- Icons are taken from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) Icon library and are utilised as classes in the `<i>` tag.
- Icons are utilised in the footer for social media links and the "top arrow" take the user back to the top menu page.

### Colors 

- I wanted the site to maintain a minimal aesthetic, colours are very basic and clean for highlighting the photos.
The primary colour used is black. With some contrasting grey which helps highlight certain areas of content on the webpage. White was used to offset the black. The use of the colours was to help with the overall layout of the page, initially on desktop it was to break up different sections of the page. 
- Text was used either black or white depending on the back ground colour of the page. I wanted it to be a good contrast between the pages. 

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/colors.jpg" alt="Color pallete" style="border: 1px solid white"></div>

### Images

<div align="center"><img src="assets/images/images.jpg" alt="Images"></div>

- All images are taken from Pexels. These images are consistent in style and colour to the website. 
- Images are responsive. For desktop they align in a row across the desktop and as the screen becomes smaller the images stack ontop of one another. 

### Styling 
- For this project I primarily used HTML and CSS to structure and style the website.

# Features
## Page Elements
### All Pages
#### Navigation Bar
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/navbar.jpg" alt="Navigation Bar Desktop View">
    <img src="assets/images/navbar2.jpg" alt="Navigation Bar for Mobile View">
</div>

- Featured on all five pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, About, Memberships, Sessions, Contact page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
- This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.
- The Navigation Bar is simple keeping to the theme of the website. 
- Each link is categorised for easy to navigate through the website. 
- The Navigation bar will highlight when the cursor is hovered over the link for a nice user experience.
- The Navigation text will highlight bold when on that particular page, to identify which page the current user is on. 
- For Mobile the logo will remain central on top of the screen and the nav bar will stack below for the user to easily scroll through with one hand. 
- I used CSS Flexbox in the navigation bar in the media queries to give a responsive navigation bar.

### Footer
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/footer.jpg" alt="Footer for Desktop View">
    <img src="assets/images/footer2.jpg" alt="Footer for Mobile View">
</div>

- The footer remains the same style on desktop and mobile to keep the consistency. 
- Consist of a "top arrow" icon to help the user return to the top of the page. 
- Social media links are located in the footer. 

### Index Page
#### Hero Section
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/index-page.jpg" alt="Index page Hero Section">
</div>

- The index page includes an image and a content box aligned next to each other with a link that will take them directly to the contact page to sign up.
- This displays a clear message from what the website is about. 
- I used CSS Flexbox here to help center the content in the center of the background container. 

### About Page
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/about-us.jpg" alt="About us page">
</div>

- Three card layout is used to display the images and content used to describe "about us".
- A black transparent background behind the card's content helps emphasise the content. 
- The three cards are responsive and will stack ontop of another when the screen size becomes smaller for mobile viewing.
- Images used are consistent with the subject content. 
- I used CSS Flexbox in the About section to align the cards in a row and give a responsive layout.

### Memberships Page
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/memberships-page.jpg" alt="Memberships page">
</div>

- Three card layout is used to display the content cards. This is keeping with the same design as the About Us Page.
- Each card has a link to sign up which takes the user to the contact page. 
- The three cards are responsive and will stack ontop of another when the screen size becomes smaller for mobile viewing.

### Sessions Page
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/sessions-page.jpg" alt="Sessions page">
</div>

- Three card layout again is used to display the content cards. This is keeping with the same design as the About Us and Memberships page. 
- A black transparent background behind the card's content helps emphasise the content. 
- Each card has a link to the contact page.
- The three cards are responsive and will stack ontop of another when the screen size becomes smaller for mobile viewing.

### Contact Page
<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/images/contact-page.jpg" alt="Contact page">
</div>

- This page will allow the user to get signed up to Feel Good Gym and Training or take them to the contact page for more information. 
- The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address.
- Page is broken down into two sections the contact form section and the location section. I've used a black back ground for the contact form section and a white background for the location section for a much better contrast on the page. 
- The interactive location map highlights the location of the gym so users can easy find the gym.
- Contact information along side the location map so user can easy find the contact details. 


### Feature Ideas
#### Future Feature Ideas
- Another feature idea would be to make for desktop viewing, the user can see all the pages in one single page.
- Links will be amended to jump from areas of the page.
